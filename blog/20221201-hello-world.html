        Hello world! This post marks the introduction of our new blog. We will use it occasionally to write about new features on // foss.events and related news. Please take note that for short notes and a radar like overview of new events on // foss.event we still have <a href="https://mastodon.social/@FOSS_events">our mastodon account</a> in place. Meaning this blog is only here for larger announcements and background information.
