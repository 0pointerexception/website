    If you know of an event that matches our criteria [<a href="#criteria">&darr;</a>] and
    you do not see it mentioned in our list of events [<a href="listofevents">&uarr;</a>],
    please <a href="mailto:onemore@foss.events?subject=one more event">contribute with an email</a>.
    Easiest option is to simply copy-paste the URL of the event into the body section of your mail and
    after checking we will list it here. If you see that some information is missing on our side, use the same
    email-address and send us the missing information.

<h2 class="navhead" id="criteria">about: criteria</h2>

<p>
    // foss.events is all about collecting and spreading FOSS events in Europe. These are mainly conferences but can
    also be meetings, *-a-thons, camps, festival, exhibitions and other kind of events - as long as they match the
    following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>only events that happen in Europe.</li>
    <li>only events that are open for the general public. Entrance fee is ok, but events shall be accessible for
        everyone to participate and in particular not restricted to a specific group like the members of a specific
        group, organisation or similar.
    </li>
    <li>only "full-day" events. As a rule of thumb, that means events that are at least 6-8 hours or more.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you know about Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software event in Europe that matches this criteria and is not yet
    in our list, please contribute [<a href="#contribute">&uarr;</a>]</p>
