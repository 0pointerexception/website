<section>
    <p>
        Planet Earth in its late 2010s: Europeans are facing massive right-wing
		populism, leading into an uprise of right-wing movements in most parts of
		the continent. In just a little of time, nationalist parties and conservative
		leaders are tearing down fundamental freedoms, checks and balances that have taken decades to be introduced and established. Borders get closed to lock-in societies. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
		FOSS does the opposite. It guarantees fundamental freedoms for everyone and rewards collective knowledge sharing. Their communities build moments of time in which Freedom enthusiasts across the continent come together to share and exchange knowledge in a friendly	and collaborative way. To grow and live (in) a free society, we need freedom of exchange, knowledge and collaboration. <strong>Freedom
        of people - just as freedom of code - is fundamental to Free, Libre and Open Source Software and their
        communities.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        // foss.events connects moments that help growing a free society. As long as inner-European borders can be crossed and international events are
		possible, we encourage you to get to know each other. Create
		international organisations, form resilient communities and build friendships
		between each other across borders. Go to a FOSS event in another country, an event where you have never been before. Get to know new people there,
		their habits, knowledge and backgrounds. Help each other and listen to each
		other. And above all do what you always love to do:
    </p>

    <p class="about-four-freedoms">
        <strong>Use, study, share and improve. Together.</strong>

   <h3 id="diversity">about:diversity</h3>

    <p>
        There are reasons and arguments why some people prefer FOSS over FLOSS or vice versa, why some refer to Open
        Source and others to Free Software or Libre Software. And who knows, potentially in the next decade even a new
        term will be created ... (We heard sustainable software is an upcoming candidate.)
    </p>

    <p>
        At // foss.events we love this diversity. All these terms have their relevance and they allow us to put slightly
        different emphasis on the same technologies. Because apart from the actual naming and the details in the
        semantics, all these names technically refer to the same kind of software: Software that is published under a
        license that grants any user the 4 freedoms to use, study, share and improve the software without limitations.
        That is why on // foss.events we will not prefer one name over the other and in case we use one, it is
        representative to all the others.</p>

		<p>Unity in diversity: <strong>No matter the name, if your event is about the four freedoms of software your
        event is part of // foss.events!</strong>

<h3 id="criteria">about:criteria</h3>

    <p>
        // foss.events is about creating and spreading the most comprehensive collection of FOSS events in Europe. Events are all kinds of conferences and unconferences, hackmeetings, *-a-thons, camps, festivals, exhibitions and other kind of events - as long as they match the
        following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>only events that <strong>happen in Europe</strong>.</li>
        <li>only events that are <strong>open for the general public</strong>. Entrance fee is
            ok, but events shall be accessible for
            everyone to participate and in particular not restricted to a specific group like the members of a specific
            group, organisation or similar.
        </li>
        <li>only <strong>"full-day" events</strong>. As a rule of thumb, that means events that are at least 6-8 hours or more.</li>
    </ul>

        yet in our list, please <a href="#contributing">contribute</a>.</p>
