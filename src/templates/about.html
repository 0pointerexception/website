<section>
    <p>
        Planet Earth in its late 2010s: Europeans are faced with an uprise of right-wing populism and movements in most parts of the continent. Nationalist ideologies, their parties and conservative leaders are tearing down fundamental freedoms, our democratic checks and balances. Freedoms that have taken decades to be introduced and to be established. While borders get locked within a day.
    </p>

    <p>
        FOSS offers the opposite. It guarantees fundamental freedoms for everyone and rewards collective knowledge
        sharing. FOSS communities and their events build moments of time in which Freedom enthusiasts across the
        continent come together to share and exchange knowledge in a friendly and collaborative way. To grow and live
        (in) a free society, we need freedom of exchange, knowledge and collaboration. <strong>Freedom of people - just
        as freedom of code - is fundamental to Free, Libre and Open Source Software and their communities.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        // foss.events connects freedom events with people who urge growing a free society. As long as inner-European
        borders can be crossed and international events are possible, we encourage you to get to know each other. Create
        international organisations, form resilient communities and build friendships between each other across borders.
        Go to a FOSS event in another country, an event where you have never been before. Get to know new people there,
        their habits, knowledge and backgrounds. Help each other and listen to each other. And above all do what you
        always love to do:
    </p>

        <strong>Use, study, share and improve. Together.</strong>

    <h3 id="criteria">about:criteria</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>// foss.events is about creating and sharing the most comprehensive collection of FOSS events in Europe
            and online</strong>. That means events that are happening in Europe or that are organised by an association
        or any group of people with their physical representation or being in Europe. While we believe in international
        communities as well, for now we put a focus on connecting Europeans or anyone else who is interested in their
        events.
    </p>

    <p>
        Valid "events" are all kinds of conferences and unconferences, hackmeetings, *-a-thons, camps, festivals,
        exhibitions and other kind of events - as long as they match the following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            only events that <strong>happen in Europe</strong> or that are organised by a group of people in Europe.
        </li>
        <li>
            only events that are <strong>open for the general public</strong>. Entrance fee is ok, but events shall be
            accessible for everyone to participate and in particular not be restricted to a specific group like the
            members of a specific group, organisation or similar.
        </li>
        <li>
            only <strong>"full-day" events</strong>. As a rule of thumb, for physical events that means events that are
            at least 6-8 hours or more. For online events it is the half with 3-4 hours.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you know about a Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software event in Europe that matches this criteria and is
        not yet in our list, please <a href="#contributing">contribute</a>.

    <h3 id="diversity">about:diversity</h3>

    <p>
        There are reasons and arguments why some people prefer FOSS over FLOSS or vice versa, why some refer to Open
        Source and others to Free Software or Libre Software. And who knows, potentially in the next decade even a new
        term will be created ... (We heard sustainable software is an upcoming candidate.)
    </p>

    <p>
        At // foss.events we love this diversity. All these terms have their relevance and they allow us to put slightly
        different emphasis on the same technologies and ideals. Because apart from the actual naming and the details in
        the semantics, all these names technically refer to the same kind of software and sharing culture: Software that
        is published under a license that grants any user the 4 freedoms to use, study, share and improve the software
        without limitations. That is why on // foss.events we will not prefer one name over the other and in case we use
        one, it is representative to all the others.</p>

    <p>
        <strong> Unity in diversity: No matter the name, if your event is about the four freedoms of software your event
            is part of // foss.events!</strong>
