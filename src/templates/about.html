<section>
    <p>
        Planet Earth in its late 2010s: Europeans are facing massive right-wing
		populism leading into an an uprise of right-wing movements in most parts of
		the continent. In just a little of time, nationalist parties and conservative
		leaders are tearing down fundamental freedoms and political freedoms that have taken
		decades to be introduced and established. Once crossing borders becomes
		a privilege again, the European society will get dispersed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
		FOSS does the opposite. It guarantees everyone fundamental freedoms and empowers political freedom. Their events, FOSS events, respectively build moments of time in which Freedom
		enthusiasts across the continent come together to share and exchange knowledge in a friendly
		and collaborative way. Exactly what we need. To grow and live (in) a free society we need freedom of exchange. We need
		human cooperation as a breeding ground for creativity and inspiration,
		for peace and mutual understanding. <strong>Freedom
        of people - just as freedom of code - is fundamental to Free, Libre and Open Source Software and their
        communities</strong> and a requirement to collectively construct our commons.
    </p>

    <p>
        // foss.events is here to help growing a free society. As long as
		inner-European borders can still be crossed and international events are
		possible, we encourage you to get to know and network with each other. Create
		international organisations, form resilient communities and build friendships
		between each other across borders. Go to a FOSS event in another country this
		year, an event where you have never been before. Get to know new people there,
		their habits, knowledge and backgrounds. Help each other and listen to each
		other. And above all do what you always love to do:
    </p>

         // foss.events fos(s)ters knowledge sharing by connecting people beyond borders and nations via <a href="/">the most comprehensive collection of Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software (related) events happening in Europe</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
       This website is a living body. It started as a simple list, written in an Etherpad and shared in the Fediverse and now grows into a 
        database-driven web-project for and by the FOSS community to help connecting people and events. If you are interested to join,  <a
            href="mailto:contact@foss.events">get in contact</a>. Or if you like to improve something, you can open an issue on <a
            href="https://github.com/foss-events/website">github</a>. Also drop by once in a while to enjoy the latest features : )
    </p>


    <h3 id="freedom">about:freedom</h3>

    <p>
        We believe in the 4 freedoms to <strong>use, study, share and improve any software</strong>. Our page is handmade and published
        as FOSS under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPLv3</a>. You <a href="https://github.com/foss-events/website">find the code
        on github</a>.

    </p>


    <h3 id="diversity">about:diversity</h3>

    <p>
        There are reasons and arguments why some people prefer FOSS over FLOSS or vice versa, why some refer to Open
        Source and others to Free Software or Libre Software. And who knows, potentially in the next decade even a new
        term will be created ... (We heard sustainable software is an upcoming candidate.)
    </p>

    <p>
        At // foss.events we love this diversity. All these terms have their relevance and they allow us to put slightly
        different emphasis on the same technologies. Because apart from the actual naming and the details in the
        semantics, all these names technically refer to the same kind of software: Software that is published under a
        license that grants any user the 4 freedoms to use, study, share and improve the software without limitations.
        That is why on // foss.events we will not prefer one name over the other and in case we use one, it is
        representative to all the others.</p>

    <p> Let us unite in diversity: <strong>No matter the name, if your event is about the four freedoms of software your
        event is part of // foss.events!</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>about:data</h2>

    <p>
        All event-data on // foss.events is <strong>collected by hand, or shared with us by the community</strong>. We try to regularly re-check the content on the site but in any case we guarantee neither completeness nor correctness of the
        data shown. In doubt, please confirm with the information given on
        the event's own website. If you find an inaccuracy on our site, please help to fix it by contributing [<a

    </p>


<h3 id="criteria">about:criteria</h3>

    <p>
        // foss.events is all about putting together and spreading the most comprehensive collection FOSS events in Europe. Often, these are all kinds of conferences but can also be meetings, *-a-thons, camps, festivals, exhibitions and other kind of events - as long as they match the
        following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>only events that happen in <strong>Europe</strong>.</li>
        <li>only events that are <strong>open for the general public</strong>. Entrance fee is
            ok, but events shall be accessible for
            everyone to participate and in particular not restricted to a specific group like the members of a specific
            group, organisation or similar.
        </li>
        <li>only <strong>"full-day" events</strong>. As a rule of thumb, that means events that are at least 6-8 hours or more.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>If you know about a Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software event in Europe that matches this criteria and is not
        yet in our list, please contribute. [<a href="#contribute">&uarr;</a>]</p>
